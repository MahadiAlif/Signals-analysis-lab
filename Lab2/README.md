## ðŸ“˜ Exercises Overview

### âœ… Exercise 1: Convolution of Signals
- Implemented convolution in three ways:
  - Using the definition formula
  - Matrix-based multiplication
  - Built-in function (`numpy.convolve`)
- Signal Definitions:
  - `x[n] = 4 * (-3/4)^n * u[n]`
  - `y[n] = 2 * r10[n - 5]`
- Output: Plot signals and compare convolution results

### âœ… Exercise 2: LTI System Analysis
- Analyze an LTI system using a block diagram
- Tasks:
  - Derive transfer function \( H(z) \)
  - Write the corresponding difference equation
  - Compute poles, zeros, and Region of Convergence (ROC)
  - Determine impulse response analytically and verify via script
  - Use \( x[n] = (1/a)^n u[n] \) as input to compute \( y[n] \)

---

### âœ… Exercise 3: Difference Equation System
- Given: \( y[n] = k_1 x[n] + k_2 x[n-1] + k_3 x[n-2] \)
  - Coefficients: \( k_1 = \frac{1}{4}, k_2 = \frac{3}{4}, k_3 = -\frac{3}{4} \)
- Tasks:
  - Create block diagram and find transfer function \( H(z) \)
  - Determine poles and zeros
  - Analyze impulse response both analytically and by script
  - Evaluate system output for input \( x[n] = r5[n - 3] \)
