# Signals and Systems â€“ Lab Experience 1

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from **Lab Experience 1** of the Signals and Systems course at Politecnico di Torino. The lab focuses on fundamental concepts in discrete-time signal analysis.

## ðŸ§ª Lab Overview

- **Course**: Signals and Systems
- **Lab Topic**: Discrete-Time Signals
- **Instructor**: Ann Margareth Rosa Brusin
- **Lab Dates**: 25th and 30th October 2024
- **Report Deadline**: 14th November 2024

> ðŸ’¡ Each script is written in **Matlab**, but the exercises can also be solved in **Python**. Adaptation for python is straightforward.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

1. **Energy and Average Power of Discrete-Time Signals**
2. **Orthogonal and Orthonormal Bases**
3. **Canonical, Fourier, and Walsh Bases**
4. **Signal Projection and Reconstruction**

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

Ensure you have Matlab installed. Then simply run any script, for example:
